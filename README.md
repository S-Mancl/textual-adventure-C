# Textual Adventure written in C
Hello all. This is a project I made for my programming classes at [SSRI (computer systems and networks security)](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/computer-systems-and-networks-security) at [Universit√† Statale degli Studi di Milano, Italy](https://www.unimi.it/en).
Here are some interesting features:
## A complete world to explore - freely
I always hated the stories which allow you to see a beautiful world behind... and don't let you explore it freely. In this game, you can travel as you want, since no plot is forcing you in a predetermined direction. You choose your own way
## The world isn't static
If you interact with the world, it changes. If you destroy a room, travel the world, and then return, you'll see it still destroyed. You can also avoid to destroy random rooms, you know?
## There are several items to get, and spells to use
As in every game should be, no single item is necessary: there is always another way.
## Random encounters
Does this feature even need more text to explain it? Random encounters can be deactivated from the settings (command: settings)
## NPCs
There are NPCs, with different alignments, and different interactions based on the alignments
## Session achievements
You can win achievements (specific to the session, not to the entire game) by performing determined actions, or the same actions multiple times.
### And probably a lot more I can't remember at the moment :-)
