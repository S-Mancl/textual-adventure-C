# Textual Adventure written in C
This is a (crazy) project I made for my Cybersecurity Programming Classes.  
Here are some interesting features:
## A complete world to explore - freely
I always hated the stories which allow you to see a beautiful world behind... and don't let you explore it freely. In this game, you can travel as you want, since no plot is forcing you in a predetermined direction.
## The world isn't static
If you interact with the world, it changes. If you destroy a room, travel the world, and then return, you'll see it still destroyed.
## There are several items to get, and spells to use
As in every game should be, no single item is necessary: there is always another way around.
## Random encounters, to enliven the world
Does this feature even need more text to explain it?
## NPCs
There are NPCs, with different alignments, and different interactions based on the alignments
## Session achievements
You can win achievements (specific to the session, not to the entire game) by performing determined actions, or the same actions multiple times.
### And probably a lot more I can't remember at the moment :-)
